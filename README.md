# gll-combinator-experiments

This is the GitHub repository containing and extending the [Replication package of Article: GLL Parsing with Flexible Combinators](https://doi.org/10.1145/3284657) for conducting empirical runtime performance experiments with the [gll-combinators](https://github.com/ltbinsbe/gll-combinators) and [fungll-combinators](https://github.com/ltbinsbe/fungll-combinators) packages.

The following acadamic papers describe the workings of these combinator libraries en use this library for empirical evaluation:  

* fungll-combinators: [Purely functional GLL parsing](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cola.2020.100945)
* gll-combinators: [GLL parsing with flexible combinators](https://doi.org/10.1145/3276604.3276618)
* Pre-prints are available [here](https://ltvanbinsbergen.nl/publications)
